<p class="subhead">The Aeropress. I'm not too much of a coffee person, but this is the cleanest and most consistent way to get caffeine in the morning. Putting the grounds in the Aeropress takes almost exactly the same amount of time as the water takes to heat. The Aeropress uses tiny little filters, so the entire process produces much less waste than a traditional drip. It's a simple process for one cup of coffee. The Aeropress barely requires cleaning - you just eject the grounds into the compost. Plus, it's a cool idea - espresso-intensity coffee with a simple machine.</p>
