<h3> Good Design</h3>
<p class="subhead">The Aeropress. Putting the grounds in the Aeropress takes almost exactly the same amount of time as the water takes to heat. The Aeropress uses tiny little filters, so the entire process produces much less waste than a traditional drip. It's a simple process for one cup of coffee. The Aeropress barely requires cleaning - you just eject the grounds into the compost. Plus, it's a cool idea - espresso-intensity coffee without any plugs, Italian machinery, or high price tag. The whole thing costs about 25 bucks.</p>
