<div id="listtime">
<p>
<h1>Cooking</h1>
<ul>
	<li>No elegant shield exists to prevent cooking grease spatters when recipe calls for uncovered pots & pans</li>
	<li>Hard to clean strainers, sieves, graters and other fine-holed things</li>
	<li>It's messy to scoop crumbs up with a sponge and hand after wiping a table down</li>
	<li>Hard to consult recipes on mobile devices without getting the mobile devices greasy.
	I'd like a handy attachment that could project recipes from computer/mobile device on to the wall.
	</li>
	<li>Pot tops get lost and it's annoying/impossible/expensive to buy new pot tops for your pots. I'd like a pot top where you can adjust the radius to fit any pot, so that I could use it for all of my different sized pots that are missing tops.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Language-learning and living abroad</h1>
<ul>
	<li>When using online/mobile dictionaries, you can't see etymologoical neighbors and adjacencies like you do in print dictionaries (this would need to be presented in a clean, graphically pleasing way - to improve language learning experience)</li>
	<li>When using online/mobile dictionaries, you don't have any benchmarks of where you are in vocabulary learning re: the whole language</li>
	<li>When learning new vocabulary, unable to tell the relative importance of the vocabulary word(ie, the relative frequency of this word's usage in the language). even better (but very complicated): when a word has multiple meanings, display the relative frequencies of each meaning's occurance, thus directing the lanague learner first to the meaning with the highest frequency.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h1>Web-design</h1>
<ul>
	<li>No way for users (who don't use "inspect element") to see the effect that design has on their perception of content. a way for users to play around with typography, design elements -to provide a better understanding of how design affects content perception.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Etc.</h1>
<ul>
	<li>No way to quickly count how much change I have, so no way to anticipate whether I should spend time looking for coins when the cashier reads out the total (especially with high coin totals, like 5.87). I'd like a handy coin organizer, that separates coins by type, with clever counters on the side like a ruler, so that I could look at my change purse and immediately know exactly how much I have in coins.</li>
</ul>
