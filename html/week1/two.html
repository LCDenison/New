<h3>cooking</h3>
<p><i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;no elegant shield exists to prevent cooking grease spatters when recipe calls for uncovered pots & pans<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;hard to clean strainers, sieves, graters and other fine-holed things<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;it's messy to scoop crumbs up with a sponge and hand after wiping a table down<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;hard to consult recipes on mobile devices without getting the mobile devices greasy.
I'd like a handy attachment that could project recipes from computer/mobile device on to the wall.<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;pot tops get lost and it's annoying/impossible/expensive to buy new pot tops for your pots. I'd like a pot top where you can adjust the radius to fit any pot, so that I could use it for all of my different sized pots that are missing tops.</p>

<h3>language-learning and living abroad</h3>
<p><i class="fa fa-star"></i></i>&nbsp; when using online/mobile dictionaries, you can't see etymologoical neighbors and adjacencies like you do in print dictionaries (this would need to be presented in a clean, graphically pleasing way - to improve language learning experience)<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;when using online/mobile dictionaries, you don't have any benchmarks of where you are in vocabulary learning re: the whole language<br><br>
<i class="fa fa-star"></i>&nbsp;when learning new vocabulary, unable to tell the relative importance of the vocabulary word(ie, the relative frequency of this word's usage in the language). even better (but very complicated): when a word has multiple meanings, display the relative frequencies of each meaning's occurance, thus directing the lanague learner first to the meaning with the highest frequency.</p><br><br>

<br>
<h3>web-design</h3>
<p><i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;no way for users (who don't use "inspect element") to see the effect that design has on their perception of content. a way for users to play around with typography, design elements -to provide a better understanding of how design affects content perception.</p><br><br>

<br>
<h3>etc.</h3>
<p><i class="fa fa-minus-square"></i>&nbsp;no way to quickly count how much change I have, so no way to anticipate whether I should spend time looking for coins when the cashier reads out the total (especially with high coin totals, like 5.87). I'd like a handy coin organizer, that separates coins by type, with clever counters on the side like a ruler, so that I could look at my change purse and immediately know exactly how much I have in coins.</p> <br><br>
