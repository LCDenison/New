<h3> Smarter Vocabulary Aquisition </h3>
	<p>I'd like to play around with the field of online/mobile dictionaries, experimenting with ways that I can make vocabulary learning more productive. I would like to better direct the energy of foreign language learners. I see existing online/mobile dictionaries as a gap, because they do not employ the data that exists about language on the internet. Instead, they are merely print dictionaries, pasted online. (This isn't true of the OED, but it has an access fee and is only for the English language.) I would like to enhance vocabulary learning by adding tools to standard online learning dictionaries, such as: bringing etyomological neighbors into the visual foreground and displaying the relative frequency that a word occurs in a language, so as to better direct the energies of the vocabulary learner.
