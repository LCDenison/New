<h3> Smarter Vocabulary Aquisition </h3>
	<p>I'd like to play around with the field of online/mobile dictionaries, experimenting with ways that I can make vocabulary learning more productive. I would like to better direct the energy of foreign lanaguge learners. To begin, I'd like to bring etyomological neighbors into the visual foreground and display the relative frequency that a word occurs in a language. I see existing online/mobile dictionaries as a gap, because they do not use all the great data available on the internet. Instead, they are merely print dictionaries, pasted online. (This isn't true of the OED, but it has an access fee and is only for the English language.)</p>
